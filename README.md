In this repository I will be doing technical interview challenges.
ALX adapted the learning method from, Holberton School, which teaches real world problems, in this repo I will be tackling challenges that are tested in technical interviews,  here I will be using Python, but I will also try these challenges in other languages particularly JavaScript, C, and  C#.
